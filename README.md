### Ideaspot is a real-time group discussion forum, centered on a single idea or question.

Imagine you're posing a question to your friends - 'where should we go out for dinner tonight?' You then create an idea board for that question, your friends get a public url, and within the context of that board people add their own ideas and suggestions, and eventually an answer can be chosen to resolve the question. All the fun is handling votes and comments on suggestions in real time.

TL;DR single-page app for real time discussion+resolution of a group question.
